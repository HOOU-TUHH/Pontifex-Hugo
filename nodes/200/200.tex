%\section{Partial Sums and Series}

The topic of this part are ``infinite sums'' of the form
\[\sum_{k=1}^\infty a_k\]
for some sequence  $(a_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$. 
Before we present a~mathematically precise definition, we present ``a little paradoxon'' 
that aims to show that one really has to be careful with series.
Consider the case where $(a_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}=((-1)^n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$. On the one hand we can compute
\begin{align*}
 \sum_{k=1}^\infty (-1)^k=&\,-1+1-1+1-1+1-1+1-1+1-\ldots\\[-0.4cm]=&\,(-1+1)+(-1+1)+(-1+1)+(-1+1)+(-1+1)+\ldots\\=&\,0+0+0+0+0+\ldots=0
\end{align*}
and on the other hand

\begin{align*}
 \sum_{k=1}^\infty (-1)^k=&\,-1+1-1+1-1+1-1+1-1+1-\ldots\\[-0.4cm]=&\,-1+(1-1)+(1-1)+(1-1)+(1-1)+(1-1)+\ldots\\=&\,-1+0+0+0+0+0+\ldots=-1.
\end{align*}
This is a~very dramatic contradiction! To exclude such awkward phenomena, we have to use a~precise mathematical definition
of ``infinite sums''.

\begin{Definition}[Infinite series]
    Let $(a_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ be a~sequence in $\mathbb{K}$. Then the sequence $(s_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ defined by
\[s_n:=\sum_{k=1}^na_k\]
is called \emph{infinite series} (or just ``\emph{series}''). The sequence element $s_n$ is called \emph{$n$-th partial sum of $(a_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$}.  
The series is called \emph{convergent} if  $(s_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ is convergent. In this case, we write
\[\sum_{k=1}^\infty a_k:=\lim_{n\to\infty}s_n.\]
\end{Definition}
\begin{Remark}{}
In the literature, the symbol $\sum_{k=1}^\infty a_k$ is also called series. So this symbol has a~twofold meaning, 
namely the limit of the series (if existent) and the series itself. At the accordant places of this manuscript, the concrete meaning will be clear from the context.\\
The above definition formally does not include infinite sums of kind
\[\sum_{k=0}^\infty a_k,\qquad\sum_{k=2}^\infty a_k,\;\;\;\text{ or }\;\;\; \sum_{k=n_0}^\infty a_k\;\text{ for some }n_0\in\mathbb{N}.\]
However, their meaning is straightforward to define and we will call these expressions infinite series, too.
\end{Remark}
