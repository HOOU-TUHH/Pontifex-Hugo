## Modifying the content

### Graph database

All connections are stored in the [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) file `nodes/graph.json`.
This file encodes all nodes and directed edges. Furthermore, the file contains and links the relevant metadata.
On the top-level it is a list containing the dictionaries `nodes` and `edges`.
In the following, we explain how the entries of the dictionaries are constructed.

#### Nodes

Example entry:
```json
    "305": {
      "id": "305",
      "label": "Epsilon-Delta\nDefinition",
      "meta": "RA28",
      "content": "A different notion of continuity using open intervals. If the input to a continuous function varies less than delta, then the output values should vary less than epsilon.",
      "notes": "305-snippet.html",
      "video": "https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4xhyqdjmxHU?start=11",
      "webwork": "https://demo.webwork.rochester.edu/webwork2/html2xml?&answersSubmitted=0&sourceFilePath=Library/Berkeley/StewCalcET7e/2.4/2-4-03.pg&problemSeed=123567890&displayMode=MathJax&courseID=daemon_course&userID=daemon&course_password=daemon&outputformat=simple",
      "exercise": "quiz.html",
      "podcast": "Click <a href=\"https://anchor.fm/profmoppi/Setsepisodes/--Relations--and-Mappings-e193jss/a-a6knu04\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> or on the thumbnail to open up a podcast episode in a separate tab!<a href=\"https://anchor.fm/profmoppi/episodes/Sets--Relations--and-Mappings-e193jss/a-a6knu04\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"./well-defined-and-wonderful.jpg\"></a><p>Courtesy of Marcus Waurick. <i>Well-defined & Wonderful podcast</i>, <a href=\"https://www.marcus-waurick.de/teaching\" target=\"_blank\">marcus-waurick.de</a>.</p>"
    }
```

This entry describes the concept node `305` for the concept "Epsilon-Delta Definition"

* `id` should be a unique three-digit number. The first digit specifies the chapter (0-9). The second and third digits run from `00` to `99`. The `id` identifies the node and is also used for defining the edges.
* `label` is the text used as title of the node. It will show as the title of the corresponding webpage and as label of the node in the graph
* `meta` contains further information for the content. In the above example, it specifies the name of the video; no routine processes this text, so one can use the entry to store further info.
* `content` explains the topic; this text shows on the top of each webpage below the title
* `notes` name of the html file containing the lecture notes.
* `video` ID (+ optional timestamp) of the YouTube video that should be linked. Can be used to either embed the video via an [`<iframe>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe) or for an external link (currently implemented).
* `webwork` link to [WeBWorK](https://github.com/openWeBWorK) exercise or other webpage that will be embedded via an [`<iframe>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe). 
* `exercise` html file (with javascript) for a quiz about the video (can be used additionally to WeBWorK or as a substitution). It will also be embedded via an [`<iframe>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe). 
* `podcast` plain html code to go in the *Podcast* section.
#### Edges

Example entry:
```json
    "005-300": {
      "source": "005",
      "target": "300",
      "label": "Boundedness of a function can be expressed in terms of the image or range."
    },
```

This entry describes the directed edge going from node `005` to node `300`.

* `source` is the `id` of the outgoing node.
* `target` is the `id` of the incoming node.
* `label` contains information on why this connection is needed. The content of `label` is displayed when one clicks on the `label` in the graph view. 

### Node content

During the creation of the website, each node automatically gets it's own standardized [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) page `xxx.md`.
The template for this page can be found in the file `nodes/dummy_for_hugo.md`.
This file encodes the overall structure of the content page for a node. A change in the template will affect all node pages simultaneously once the webpage has been rebuilt.
The template uses certain marker-words that are replaced with specific counterparts during the build process. In particular, the information from the `JSON` database will be filled in.
In the following, we describe which data needs to be provided in order to start building the webpage.

#### TeX snippets

Each node provides a section called "Notes". 
For your nodes to show up here, an `HTML`-file needs to be provided and will be included automatically by the build-process. 
The name of this `HTML` is stored in the attribute `notes` in each entry of the `JSON` database.
It should reside in the folder `nodes/xxx/xxx-node.html` where  `xxx` stands for the specific node.

The current version of Pontifex assumes that you provide a file `nodes/xxx/xxx.tex` for each node, i.e., a `TeX`-file containing the content for each notes-section.
This file will be parsed to `HTML` using `pandoc` during the creation process.
User-specific macros are stored centrally in the file `nodes/packages.tex`. 
We suggest to refrain from using user-specific macros as `pandoc` may be struggling to resolve the macros.
You may find [de-macro](https://ctan.org/pkg/de-macro) helpful for automatized resolution of TeX-macros.
For details on the preprocessing of TeX Snippets, refer to the developer documentation below.

##### Including Images

We recommend using vector graphics like `.svg`. If your code contains TiKz, we recommend to use the `standalone` package in order to create an `.svg`-file.

In order to include the image `image.svg` in the node `107`, inside the file `107/107.tex` use the code
```latex
\includegraphics{./image.svg}
```
and place `image.svg` also in the `107` folder.

###### Using HUGO Shortcodes

HUGO Shortcodes work inside `.tex` files due to the `sed`-postprocessing
```bash
sed -i -e 's/{{&lt; baseurl &gt;}}/{{< baseurl >}}/g' $i/$i-snippet.html
```
inside `build_pontifex.sh`.

#### YouTube videos

##### Thumbnails and External Links

In order to cope with internet privacy requirements, the current version of Pontifex does not embed YouTube Videos but external links. This is realized the file `nodes/dummy_for_hugo.md` via the snippet
```html
Click [here](https://youtu.be/###YTURLEND###) or on the thumbnail below to open up the YouTube video in a separate tab!
<a href="https://youtu.be/###YTURLEND###" target="_blank">
  <img src="./###YTID###.jpg">
</a>
```
In order to keep using this snippet for other YouTube videos, the corresponding thumbnail needs to be saved in the folder `nodes/xxx`, where `xxx` corresponds to the node id.
The thumbnail name should be `ytid.jpg`, where `ytid` is the YouTube-Id of the corresponding video, e.g., the video `https://youtu.be/iA-Dtf7529M` has the id `iA-Dtf7529M`.
In order to appropriately download and save the thumbnails, you may use the script `bin/get_thumbnails.py`.

##### YouTube shortcode

Alternatively, you can include YouTube Videos via the `youtube` [shortcode](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/). 
Here the URL specified in the `video` attribute of the `JSON` database is used, starting from `/embed/...`.
See [here](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/171780?hl=en) for more information on embedding YouTube videos.
In order to use the `youtube` shortcode, in the file `nodes/dummy_for_hugo.md`, you need to substitute the paragraph
```html
###VIDEO###
```
by
```
{{< tab tabName="Video">}}
{{< youtube "###YTURLEND###">}}
{{< /tab >}}
```

#### Podcast episodes

This section is optional and will only be processed when the `podcast` attribute in the `JSON` database is nonempty. 
En empty entry looks like
```JSON
      "podcast": ""
```

If "podcast" is nonempty, the full `HTML`-content will by copied to the corresponding section in the template.
The original version of Pontifex uses either `<iframe>` code provided by the podcast hosters, e.g. [AnchorFM](https://anchor.fm/), 
```html
      "podcast": "<iframe src=\"https://anchor.fm/profmoppi/embed/episodes/Rearrangement-of-Series-with-Fabian-Gabel-e1iq2sr/a-a7vb2vp\" height=\"102px\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><p>Courtesy of Marcus Waurick. <i>Well-defined & Wonderful podcast</i>, <a href=\"https://www.marcus-waurick.de/teaching\">marcus-waurick.de</a>.</p>"
```
or provides short snippets to include content that has been copied to the server.
```html
      "podcast": "<audio controls src=\"/e-10/pontifex/podcast/imvt.mp3\">Your browser does not support the <code>audio</code> element.</audio>"},
```

#### Discussion forum

The current version of Pontifex uses a discussion tab on each webpage.
Each discussion features a GitHub-Like discussion thread provided by [Vssue](https://vssue.js.org/).
In order to enable Vssue on your own instance of Pontifex, follow the following steps
* In case you are not hosting your repo on GitHub, create a public repo on GitHub repository and generate the `clientID` and `clientSecret` yourself to make it work. Refer to https://vssue.js.org/guide/github.html for how to do that.
* Modify the following portion of your `layouts/partial/footer/script-footer.html` by changing all of the exemplary values to the ones of your repo.

```javascript
// here set the options for your OAuth App
options: {
  owner: 'owner',
  repo: 'repo-name',
  clientId: 'generate-one-on-github',
  clientSecret: 'generate-one-on-github', // only required for some of the platforms
  labels: ['Comment'],
  prefix: '[Pontifex Website] ',
},
```

* Log in to comment.

#### WeBWorK or other electronic exercises

The bottom of each page includes an electronic [WeBWorK](https://github.com/openwebwork/) exercise in the form of an [`<iframe>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe).
```json
"webwork": "https://demo.webwork.rochester.edu/webwork2/html2xml?&answersSubmitted=0&sourceFilePath=Library/Berkeley/StewCalcET7e/2.4/2-4-03.pg&problemSeed=123567890&displayMode=MathJax&courseID=daemon_course&userID=daemon&course_password=daemon&outputformat=simple",
```
will render the exercise once the webpage has been loaded.

Details on the WeBWorK course creation can be found [here](https://michaelgage.blogspot.com/2015/06/whether-writing-full-text-book-or-just.html).

The problemSeed is randomized via JavaScript+RegEx and will change everytime the page is reloaded, see `/layouts/shortcodes/webwork.html` for details.

##### Pontifex-Coloring in WeBWorK Buttons

To this end use the CSS-theme `nodes/math4-pontifex-coloring.css` and include it in your WeBWorK-Service.

## Adding Branding to your pntfx Project

In order to add a university or institute logo, just overwrite the files

`/static/images/university-logo.svg` and `/static/images/institute-logo.svg`

or use a separate repository for branding your project as described in the developer info below.

# Developer info

## Python preprocessing

`*.py` files in `bin`-folder:

| Preprocessor | Description |
| - | - |
| `build_json.py` | Build `JSON` file for each node containing only neighbors of distance 1 |
| `build_md.py` | Build `MD` file for each node substituting placeholders by node-specific values |

## Build process

In order to build the HUGO project, the Bash-script `/bin/build_pontifex.sh` needs to be executed. 
The build process consists of 3 parts: 
1) Preprocessing using the Python scripts and [`pandoc`](https://pandoc.org/).
2) Copying the files to their location to be picked up by HUGO.
3) Running HUGO to create the static webpage. The resulting files are then located in the folder `public`.

## Cytoscape.js

We rely on [Cytoscape.js](https://js.cytoscape.org/) in order to visualize the graph.

Colors and functionality of the graph are encoded in the files
`static/js/vendor/pontifex-graph.js`

Each page using a Cytoscape.js graph needs to include a specific `header1.html` page. See the shortcode below.

## Pandoc

Translation of `TeX` to `HTML` with MathJax support is achieved with [`pandoc`](https://pandoc.org/).
If building the Pontifex project locally without the use of the provided Docker container make sure to have a `pandoc` version >= 2.18.

## Node

The HUGO project is built using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).
If building the Pontifex project locally without the use of the provided Docker container make sure to have a `node` version >= 18.5.

## Dummies, templates, and shortcodes

`nodes/dummy_for_hugo.md` specifies the overall structure of each page.
We use special shortcodes for including WeBWorK exercises and Tabs, see `layouts/shortcodes/` for details.

### `header1`

This  is needed for the Cytoscape.js objects to function properly. 
The syntax is `{{< header1 "index">}}` where `index` specifies the id of the node and will be used in order to load the node-specific `JSON`-file.

### `header2`

Same as `header1` but this is used only on for the overview page and not in `dummy_for_hugo.md`

### `plausible`

In order to enable [plausible.io](https://plausible.io/), every page that needs web analytics should include `layouts/partials/header/plausible.html` via
```html
{{ partial "header/plausible.html" }}
```
The unbranded version of Pontifex uses an empty file. In order to use your plausible data, change the file content to
```html
<script defer data-domain="your-domain.com" src="https://plausible.io/js/plausible.js"></script>
```
see, the [Plausible Documentation](https://plausible.io/docs/) for details on registration and implementation on your webpage.

## Branding 

All files that apply some sort of branding reside in the **private** repository

https://collaborating.tuhh.de/hoou-an-der-tuhh-projekte/pontifex/pontifex-brand

Content is copied to their respective locations in the `.gitlab-ci.yml`-stage: `brand`.

As `pontifex-brand` is private, the repo `pontifex-hugo` needs to have an *access token* in the pipeline variables in order to clone `pontifex-brand`. The presently used token was generated within `pontifex-brand`/Settings/Access Tokens with `read repository` scope and added to `pontifex-hugo` as the pipeline variable `PROJECT_TOKEN`.

## Development environment using Docker

Download or clone `pontifex-hugo` first
```bash
git clone git@collaborating.tuhh.de:hoou-an-der-tuhh-projekte/pontifex/pontifex-hugo.git
```
Follow the instructions on https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/ to install Docker on your machine.
Note that the process below for building the Pontifex project needs to be repeated each time you modify the source files of your webpage.

### Building the Docker image locally and building the HUGO project

Within a git-clone of [`pontifex-hugo`](https://collaborating.tuhh.de/hoou-an-der-tuhh-projekte/pontifex/pontifex-hugo) run 
```bash
docker build . -t pontifex-hugo
```
This process should also be carried out every time, an update of `pontifex-hugo/Dockerfile` is carried out.

Now, run 
```bash
docker run -it --rm -v `pwd`:/app -w /app pontifex-hugo ./bin/build_pontifex.sh
```
to build the project.

### Building the HUGO project with an external Docker image

Within a git-clone of [`pontifex-hugo`](https://collaborating.tuhh.de/hoou-an-der-tuhh-projekte/pontifex/pontifex-hugo), run
```bash
docker run -it --rm -v `pwd`:/app -w /app collaborating.tuhh.de:5005/hoou-an-der-tuhh-projekte/pontifex/pontifex-hugo:latest ./bin/build_pontifex.sh
```

This will use the root image from the [Container Registry](https://collaborating.tuhh.de/hoou-an-der-tuhh-projekte/pontifex/pontifex-hugo/container_registry/).

You may need to
```
docker login collaborating.tuhh.de:5005
```
and authenticate first. Note that, the first time you `docker run` the above command, it may take longer as the image needs to be downloaded first.

### Starting a web server

If your build process was successful, you find all files to be hosted in the folder `public`.
Within your `pontifex-hugo` folder, you may start up a web server via
```
docker run -it --rm --name apache-server -p 8080:80 -v `pwd`/public:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/ httpd:2.4-alpine
```
and open up http://localhost:8080/ in order to view the Pontifex webpage on your machine.

## Further configuration

### Darkmode

HUGO-Doks comes with a darkmode capability that has been disabled in order to prevent the usage of local storage on the client side. In order to activate the darkmode adapt the file `config/_default/params.toml` to read
```toml
darkMode = true
```

### Push Mirroring to GitHub

The protected branches `master` and `dev` are [push mirrored](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/mirror/push.html) to the GitHub repository: https://github.com/HOOU-TUHH/Pontifex-Hugo.

To this end, this repo uses password authentication with a [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) from GitHub using the *repo* and *workflow* scope.
