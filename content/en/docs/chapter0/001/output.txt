## Sets {#sets .unnumbered}

Modern mathematics does not say what sets are, but only specifies rules.
This is, however, too difficult for us right now, and we rather cite the
attempt of a definition by Georg Cantor:

::: Boxx
**Concept 1**. "Unter einer â€šMenge' verstehen wir jede Zusammenfassung
von bestimmten wohlunterschiedenen Objekten unserer Anschauung oder
unseres Denkens zu einem Ganzen."
:::

::: Definition
A *set* is a collection into a whole of definite, distinct objects of
our perception or of our thought. Such an object $x$ of a set $M$ is
called an *element* of $M$ and one writes $x\in M$. If $x$ is not such
an object of $M$, we write $x\not\in M$.
:::

A set is defined by giving all its elements $M:=\{1,4,9\}$.

::: Boxx
**Concept 2**. The symbol "$:=$" is read as and means that the symbol
$M$ is newly introduced as a set by the given elements.
:::

::: example
**Example 3**.

-   The empty set $\{\} = \emptyset = \varnothing$ is the unique set
    that has no elements at all.

-   The set that contains the empty set $\{ \varnothing \}$, which is
    non-empty since it has exactly one element.

-   A finite set of numbers is $\{ 1,2,3\}$.
:::

::: notation
**Notation 4**. Let $A,B$ be sets:

-   $x \in A$ means $x$ is an element of $A$

-   $x\not\in A$ means $x$ is not an element of $A$

-   $A \subset B$ means $A$ is a subset of $B$: every element of $A$ is
    contained in $B$

-   $A \supset B$ means $A$ is a superset of $B$: every element of $B$
    is contained in $A$

-   $A=B$ means $A \subset B \wedge A \supset B$. Note that the order of
    the elements does not matter in sets. If we want the order to
    matter, we rather define *tuples*: $(1,2,3) \neq (1,3,2)$. For sets,
    we always have $\{ 1,2,3 \} = \{1, 3,2\}$.

-   $A \subsetneq B$ means $A$ is a "proper" subset of $B$, every
    element of $A$ is contained in $B$, but $A \neq B$.
:::

::: Boxx
**Concept 5** (The important number sets).

-   $\N$ is the set of the natural numbers $1,2,3,\ldots$;

-   $\N_0$ is the set of the natural numbers and zero:
    $0, 1, 2, 3,\dots$;

-   $\Z$ is the set of the integers, which means
    $\ldots,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,\ldots$;

-   $\Q$ is the set of the rational numbers, which means all fractions
    $\frac pq$ with $p\in\Z$ and $q\in\N$;

-   $\R$ is the set of the real numbers (see next semester).

Other ways to define sets: $$\begin{aligned}
 A &= \{ n \in \mathbb{N} : 1 \le n \le 300 \}\\
 \mathbf{P}(B) &= \{ M : M \subset B \} \mbox{ power set: set of all subsets of } B\\
 I &= \{ x\in \mathbb{R} : 1 \le x < \pi \} = [1,\pi) \mbox{ half-open interval }\end{aligned}$$

::: Definition
We use vertical bars $|\cdot|$ around a set to denote the number of
elements. For example, we have $|\{1,4,9\}|=3$. The number of elements
is called the *cardinality* of the set.
:::

::: example
**Example 6**. $|\{1,3,3,1\}|=2$, $\quad |\{1,2,3, \ldots, n \}| = n$,
$\quad | \mathbb{N} | = \infty$ (?)

::: exercise
**Exercise 7** (Which of the following logical statements are true?).
*$$\corr{3\in \N}, \qquad \corr{12034\in\N}, \qquad \false{-1\in\N}, \qquad \false{0\in\N}, \qquad \corr{0\in\N_0}$$
$$\corr{-1\in\Z}, \qquad \false{0\notin\Z}, \qquad \false{-2.7\in\Z}, \qquad \false{\tfrac23\in\Z},$$
$$\corr{\tfrac23\in\Q}, \qquad \corr{-3\in\Q}, \qquad \corr{-2.7\in\Q}, \qquad \false{\sqrt{2}\in\Q},$$
$$\corr{\sqrt{2}\in\R}, \qquad \false{\sqrt{-2}\in\R}, \qquad \corr{-\tfrac23\in\R}, \qquad \corr{0\in\R}.$$*
